# HPE CSI Driver for Kubernetes

A Container Storage Interface ([CSI](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec)) Driver for Kubernetes. The HPE CSI Driver for Kubernetes allows you to use a [Container Storage Provider](https://github.com/hpe-storage/container-storage-provider) (CSP) to perform data management operations on storage resources.

## Releases

The CSI driver is released with a set of container images published on Quay. Those are in turn referenced from deployment manifests, Helm charts and Operators (see next section). Relases are rolled up on the [HPE Storage Container Orchestrator Documentation](https://scod.hpedev.io/csi_driver/index.html#compatibility_and_support) (SCOD) portal.

- Release notes are hosted in [release-notes](release-notes).

## Deploying and using the CSI driver on Kubernetes

All documentation for installing and using the CSI driver with a HPE storage backend (CSP) is available on [SCOD](https://scod.hpedev.io/csi_driver/deployment.html).

Release vehicles include:

- [HPE CSI Driver for Kubernetes Helm chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/hpe-storage/hpe-csi-driver)
- [HPE CSI Operator for Kubernetes](https://operatorhub.io/operator/hpe-csi-operator).

Source deployment manifests are available in [hpe-storage/co-deployments](https://github.com/hpe-storage/co-deployments).

## Building

Instructions on how to build the HPE CSI Driver can be found in [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md).

## Testing

Example Kubernetes object definitions used to build test cases for the CSI driver are available in [examples](examples).
